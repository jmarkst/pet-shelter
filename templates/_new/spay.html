                        <p class="card-text">At our shelter, we are deeply committed to the health and well-being of every pet. One of the most impactful ways we support this mission is through our Spay and Neuter Program. This program is designed not only to improve the lives of individual animals but also to address the broader issue of pet overpopulation in our community.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="mt-4">Why Spay or Neuter?</h4>
                        <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
                          <li class="list-group-item">Helps control the pet population and reduces the number of homeless animals, preventing unnecessary euthanasia.</li>
                          <li class="list-group-item">Promotes healthier, longer lives by reducing the risk of certain cancers and infections, such as uterine infections and testicular cancer.</li>
                          <li class="list-group-item">Minimizes behavioral issues like roaming, spraying, and aggression, making pets more docile and family-friendly.</li>

                        <h4 class="mt-4">How the Program Works</h4>
                        <img src="/pics/spay"/>
                        <p>When you adopt from our shelter, your pet will already be spayed or neutered, ensuring they're ready for a healthy start in their new home. We also offer affordable spay and neuter services for community pets, including financial assistance for pet owners in need. Our dedicated veterinary team ensures a safe, comfortable procedure for every animal, followed by careful monitoring during the recovery process.</p>
                        <p>Appointments can be scheduled online or by visiting our shelter. We provide pre-surgical consultations to answer any questions and ensure that your pet is healthy and ready for the procedure.</p>
                  
                        <h4 class="mt-4">Benefits to the Community</h4>
                        <p>By reducing the number of stray and homeless animals, our program helps create a safer, cleaner, and more compassionate community. Fewer stray animals mean fewer incidents of accidents, fewer public health concerns, and a reduction in the strain on local animal control resources.</p>
